Is Bitcoin vulnerable to quantum computing?,Yes, most systems relying on cryptography in general are, including traditional banking systems. However, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. In the event that quantum computing could be an imminent threat to Bitcoin, the protocol could be upgraded to use post-quantum algorithms.
How does Bitcoin mining work?,Bitcoin mining works by using the resources on contributing computers. The users CPU solves an easily verifiable yet provable mathmatical problem which is used to create Blocks of transactions. When the netowork verifies the correct answer the miner is award newly minted coin.
How does Bitcoin work?,Bitcoin works by moulding trust amogst Bitcoin users. Client side processes are employed to validate the ledger to verfy trust. The ledger is built off of cryptographic signatures than can be verified all the way to the making of the first Bitcoin.
How does one acquire bitcoins?,You can get bitcoin through payment for goods or services, purchasing bitcoins at a Bitcoin exchange or earning bitcoins through competitive mining. While it may be possible to find individuals who wish to sell bitcoins in exchange for a credit card or PayPal payment, most exchanges do not allow funding via these payment methods. This is due to cases where someone buys  bitcoins with PayPal, and then reverses their half of the transaction. This is commonly referred to as a chargeback.
Why do bitcoins have value?,Bitcoins have value because they are useful as a form of money. Bitcoin has the characteristics of money (durability, portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability). It's these properties that establishes a valuation that users trust and is measured by other established currencies.
Won't the finite amount of bitcoins be a limitation?,Bitcoin is unique in that only 21 million bitcoins will ever be created being a finite number. However, this will never be a limitation because transactions can be denominated in smaller sub-units of a bitcoin, such as bits - there are 1,000,000 bits in 1 bitcoin. Bitcoins can be divided up to 8 decimal places (0.000 000 01) and potentially even smaller units if that is ever required in the future as the average transaction size decreases.
What are the disadvantages of Bitcoin?,The two major disadvanteges to Bitcoin is it's volatility and it's ongoing development. Bitcoin is volatile in that it's trading rate changes rapidly.  Occassionally, improvements are added to the network due to the technology being new and improving over time.
What do I need to start mining?,In the early days of Bitcoin, anyone could find a new block using their computer's CPU. As more and more people started mining, the difficulty of finding new blocks increased greatly to the point where the only cost-effective method of mining today is using specialized hardware. You can visit BitcoinMining.com for more information.
Can Bitcoin be regulated?,The Bitcoin protocol itself cannot be regulated without the cooperation of nearly all its users, who choose what software they use. It is not governed by any government though it can be influenced.
How Does The Blockchain Work?,The blockchain works by recording all of the newly minted bitcoins rewarded to miners who find blocks. Blocks are sets of sent/received transactions that miners confirm for the network. As these actions take place within the Bitcoin protocol the blockchain acts as a ledger of account for all transactions undertaken within the Bitcoin network.
Doesn't Bitcoin unfairly benefit early adopters?,Some early adopters have large numbers of bitcoins because they took risks and invested time and resources in an unproven technology that was hardly used by anyone and that was much harder to secure properly. As with any investiment early investors benefit and profit from taking the increased risk.
Won't Bitcoin fall in a deflationary spiral?,The deflationary spiral theory says that if prices are expected to fall, people will move purchases into the future in order to benefit from the lower prices. That fall in demand will in turn cause merchants to lower their prices to try and stimulate demand, making the problem worse and leading to an economic depression.
Is Bitcoin legal?,To the best of our knowledge, Bitcoin has not been made illegal by legislation in most jurisdictions. However, some jurisdictions such as Argentina and Russia severely restrict or ban foreign currencies. Other jurisdictions such as Thailand may limit the licensing of certain entities such as Bitcoin exchanges. For the United States the established legality of Bitcoin is sound.
What if someone creates a better digital currency?,That can happen. For now, Bitcoin remains by far the most popular decentralized cryptocurrency, but there can be no guarantee that it will retain that position. There is already a set of alternative 
Hasn't Bitcoin been hacked in the past?,The rules of the protocol and the cryptography used for Bitcoin are still working years after its inception, which is a good indication that the concept is well designed. However, security flaws exist in 3rd party applications when developers try to cut corners or hack together insecure solutions.
What about Bitcoin and consumer protection?,Consumers are protected by the integrity of the ledger. The security of their accounts is based on well known cryptographic systems. However, it remains to be seen if any consumer protection organzations will involve themselves in Bitcoin.
What is Bitcoin mining?,Mining is the process of spending computing power to process transactions, secure the network, and keep everyone in the system synchronized together. It is very similar to minting coin. The mining process creates coins usable in the network. Bticoins do not exist until they are mined.
Who controls the Bitcoin?,Nobody or any one person owns or has possesion of the keys to Bitcoin. Each member contributes to Bitcoin as a whole and agree on it's state creating a sort of group ownership with no central control.
How difficult is it to make a Bitcoin payment?,Bitcoin payments are easier to make than debit or credit card purchases, and can be received without a merchant account. Payments are made from a wallet application, either on your computer or smartphone, by entering the recipient's address, the payment amount, and pressing send. To make it easier to enter a recipient's address, many wallets can obtain the address by scanning a QR code or touching two phones together with NFC technology.
What is the Blockchain?,The Blockchain is a chain of blocks that represent the legder of the Bitcoin network. Each block contains transactions that have occured and link to a previous block all the way to the very first Genisis block.
What if someone bought up all the existing bitcoins?,Only a fraction of bitcoins issued to date are found on the exchange markets for sale. Bitcoin markets are competitive, meaning the price of a bitcoin will rise or fall depending on supply and demand. It would be impracticle for someone to purchase all the existing coins and maintain that until all coins are available.
Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?,A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from their own money, or the money paid by subsequent investors, instead of from profit earned by the individuals running the business. Bitcoin meets non of these cryteria nor any scam for that matter.
Why is bitcoin important?,Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system with no central authority. It plays a crucial part of economic importances for managing a ledger across untrusted parties.
Is Bitcoin secure?,The Bitcoin technology - the protocol and the cryptography - has a strong security track record. Bitcoin's most common vulnerability is in user error. Bitcoin wallet files that store the necessary private keys can be accidentally deleted, lost or stolen. In those cases the security issue is the end user and not the technology.
What happens when bitcoins are lost?,When a user loses his wallet, it has the effect of removing money out of circulation. Lost bitcoins still remain in the block chain just like any other bitcoins. However, lost bitcoins remain dormant forever because there is no way for anybody to find the private key(s) that would allow them to be spent again. Because of the law of supply and demand, when fewer bitcoins are available, the ones that are left will be in higher demand and increase in value to compensate.
What about Bitcoin and taxes?,Bitcoin is not a fiat currency with legal tender status in any jurisdiction, but often tax liability accrues regardless of the medium used. There is a wide variety of legislation in many different jurisdictions which could cause income, sales, payroll, capital gains, or some other form of tax liability to arise with Bitcoin.
Can I make money with Bitcoin?,You should never expect to get rich with Bitcoin or any emerging technology. With that said, many speculators have gained profited from the lucrative net growth of the Bitcoin value.
Who created Bitcoin?,Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. At that time tools were used to make and produce the coins, creating the Bitcoin ledger as we know it today.
What determines bitcoin's price?,The price of a bitcoin is determined by supply and demand. When demand for bitcoins increases, the price increases, and when demand falls, the price falls. There is only a limited number of bitcoins in circulation and new bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable. Because Bitcoin is still a relatively small market compared to what it could be, it doesn't take significant amounts of money to move the market price up or down, and thus the price of a bitcoin is still very volatile.
What does synchronizing mean and why does it take so long?,Long synchronization time is only required with full node clients. Technically speaking, synchronizing is the process of downloading and verifying all previous Bitcoin transactions on the network. For some Bitcoin clients to calculate the spendable balance of your Bitcoin wallet and make new transactions, it needs to be aware of all previous transactions.
How does mining create unique Bitcoin?,Mining creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that makes it very difficult for anyone to consecutively add duplicate blocks of transactions into the block chain. This protects the neutrality of the network by preventing any singular individual from gaining the power to block certain transactions. Beause of the properties of the Blockchain, each transaction can be traced to it's unqiue coin inception.
Is Bitcoin fully virtual and immaterial?,Bitcoin is as virtual as the credit cards and online banking networks people use everyday. It is nonmaterial in the sense that everything is digital but most of the banking industry works with way already. Transactions are indiffernt to the type of currency being traded as they are just a record of accounts.
What if I receive a bitcoin when my computer is powered off?,This works fine. The bitcoins will appear next time you start your wallet application. Bitcoins are not actually received by the software on your computer, they are appended to a public ledger that is shared between all the devices on the network. If you are sent bitcoins when your wallet client program is not running and you later launch it, it will download blocks and catch up with any transactions it did not already know about, and the bitcoins will eventually appear as if they were just received in real time. Your wallet is only needed when you wish to spend bitcoins.
Can bitcoins become worthless?,Yes. History is littered with currencies that failed and are no longer used, such as the German Mark during the Weimar Republic and, more recently, the Zimbabwean dollar. These values have dropped and have been useless to use in any further transactions. Bitcoin is no different.
Is Bitcoin really used by people?,Yes. Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency and used used by many people. Due to it's nature it's impossible to tell how many people utilise bitcoin but at the end of April 2017, the total value of all existing bitcoins exceeded 20 billion US dollars. There are many examples of people using Bitcoin and apply it's value to everyday items such as the very first purchase which was a Pizza.
Can Bitcoin scale to become a major payment network?,The Bitcoin network can already process a much higher number of transactions per second than it does today. It is, however, not entirely ready to scale to the level of major credit card networks. It is a system still in development and is expeted to be a major payment system in the future.
Is Bitcoin a bubble?,A fast rise in price does not constitute a bubble. An artificial over-valuation that will lead to a sudden downward correction constitutes a bubble. Bubbles inevitably lead to crashes and Bitcoin appears to have a lot of room to grow.
Is Bitcoin anonymous?,Bitcoin is designed to allow its users to send and receive payments with an acceptable level of privacy as well as any other form of money. However, Bitcoin is not anonymous and cannot offer the same level of privacy as cash.
What Is A Full Node?,Full nodes, or clients, validate transactions within the blockchain and are voluntarily maintained by individuals, groups and organizations (such as merchants for example) all around the world and broadcast all the messages within the protocol. Full nodes add an additional layer of security for these participants within the Bitcoin network and operate in an altruistic client meaning they work without reward.
Why do people trust Bitcoin?,Trust in Bitcoin comes from the mathematical properties of encryption and signatures that validate the validity of each block in the Blockchain. The ledger integrity is considered secure for these reasons.
What Can You get With Bitcoin?,You can purchase just about anything with bitcoins, from goods like clothing, electronics, food and art to handmade crafts. Bitcoin can also be used to get large items like cars, real estate, and investment vehicles such as precious metals. By using Purse.io users can buy just about anything from Amazon and get a discount of up to 20% and other bargains just by using Bitcoin.
How much will the transaction fee be?,Transactions can be processed without fees, but trying to send free transactions can require waiting days or weeks. Although fees may increase over time, normal fees currently only cost a tiny amount. By default, all Bitcoin wallets listed on Bitcoin.org add what they think is an appropriate fee to your transactions; most of those wallets will also give you chance to review the fee before sending the transaction.
Could users collude against Bitcoin?,It is not possible to change the Bitcoin protocol easily with collusion. Any Bitcoin client that doesn't comply with the same rules cannot enforce their own rules on other users. As per the current specification, double spending is not possible on the same block chain, and neither is spending bitcoins without a valid signature. Therefore, it is not possible to conspire to generate uncontrolled amounts of bitcoins out of thin air, spend other users' funds, corrupt the network, or anything similar.
What are the advantages of Bitcoin?,Payment freedom - It is possible to send and receive bitcoins anywhere in the world at any time. Traditional currency is disfavored over Bitcoin as transactions can be reversed. Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed enabling users to have the advantage of fuller control.
How are bitcoins created?,You can get bitcoin through payment for goods or services, purchasing bitcoins at a Bitcoin exchange or earning bitcoins through competitive mining. While it may be possible to find individuals who wish to sell bitcoins in exchange for a credit card or PayPal payment, most exchanges do not allow funding via these payment methods. This is due to cases where someone buys  bitcoins with PayPal, and then reverses their half of the transaction. This is commonly referred to as a chargeback.
Isn't speculation and volatility a problem for Bitcoin?,This is a chicken and egg situation. For bitcoin's price to stabilize, a large scale economy needs to develop with more businesses and users. For a large scale economy to develop, businesses and users will seek for price stability. Until these stabilize, the value of Bitcoin will be volatile creating problems that need to be solved by investors and users. 
Is Bitcoin useful for illegal activities?,Bitcoin is money, and money has always been used both for legal and illegal purposes. Cash, credit cards and current banking systems widely surpass Bitcoin in terms of their use to finance crime. Like anything else, Bitcoin can be used in a crime but that does not make the use of Bitcoin illegal.
How To Accept Bitcoin Payments For Your Store?,It is very easy for any merchant to accept Bitcoin, and most of the time preparing to add the feature to your payment services takes less than 10 minutes. Merchants can assume Bitcoin both online and at physical locations by using a merchant service payment provider like Bitpay, or even just using a simple wallet address generated on their own device in which users can send payments.
Why do I have to wait for confirmation?,User should expect some delay in transaction confirmation. Each block takes an average of a 10 minute delay until it's available to network. The network must check, confirm, and verify all transactions before they are trusted. User can wait longer which increases security. Waiting for 6 blocks to be verified is the recommend delay for large transactions.
Isn't Bitcoin mining a waste of energy?,Spending energy to secure and operate a payment system is hardly a waste. Like any other payment service, the use of Bitcoin entails processing costs. Services necessary for the operation of currently widespread monetary systems, such as banks, credit cards, and armored vehicles, also use a lot of energy. Bitcoin is not considered any more wasteful then many other services.
